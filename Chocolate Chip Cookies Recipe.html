    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F) and line a baking tray with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Cream together 1 cup of softened butter, 1 cup of white sugar, and 1 cup of brown sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Beat in 2 large eggs, one at a time. Then add 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and mix well.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together 3 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, ½ teaspoon of baking powder, and ½ teaspoon of salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing until a soft dough forms.</li>
        <li>Fold in 2 cups of chocolate chips</li>
        <li>Scoop tablespoon-sized balls of dough and place them on the baking tray, leaving space between each cookie.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 12 minutes or until the edges are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking tray for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>For softer cookies, take them out of the oven when they still look slightly underdone in the center. They will continue to cook while cooling on the tray.</p>
